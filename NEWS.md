# mlr3filters 0.4.0

- Add ReliefF filter (#86)
- Fix praznik scores calculation: praznik filters are not monotone in the selected features due to their iterative fashion. E.g., the first selected feature can have a score of 5, the second selected feature a score of 10. This version replaces the praznik scores by a simple sequence (#87, @mllg)


# mlr3filters 0.3.0

- Add Permutation (#70)
- Add `flts()` (#77)
- Github Actions: set cron job to 4am to avoid potential download issues with R-devel on macOS
- Filters now have a help method `$help()` which opens the respective help page (#68)
